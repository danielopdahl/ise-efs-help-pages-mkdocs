## <a id="A">User Role Name</a>

The User Role Name identifies the user role. It must be unique within the organization. Uniqueness checking is case insensitive and includes both deleted and non-deleted records.

## <a id="B">What are features?</a>

A feature is an aspect of functionality that a user has access to. For example, the Resources feature controls access to Drivers, Asset Types, Asset Groups, Assets, and Locations. Each feature listed on the User Role Detail page has an explanation of what functionality it controls in the legend on the right side of the screen.

## <a id="C">How does View Only permission to a feature differ from View/Modify permission to a feature?</a>

View Only permission allows application users to view and print records relating to the feature but prevents them from making any changes to those records. View/Modify permission allows application users not only to view and print records but also to create, update, delete, and restore records.

## <a id="D">What is Web Service Access?</a>

A web service allows different computers to exchange data with each other over the internet without human intervention. If an application user will be using the website only, it is not necessary to give that application user any sort of Web Service Access.

If you have further questions regarding the use of web services, please contact your Customer Support representative.
